**Exercise Description**
A contemporary Parallel Bar exercise consists predominantly of swing and flight elements selected from all available Element Groups and performed with continuous transitions through various hang and support positions in such a way as to reflect the full potential of the apparatus.

**Table of Elements**
- [[EG I - Elements in support or through support on 2 bars]]
- [[EG II -  Elements starting in upper arm position]]
- [[EG III - Long swings in hang on 1 or 2 bars and underswings]]
- [[5 PB/EG IV/EG IV - Dismounts|EG IV - Dismounts]]

**Information about the "D Score"**
1. The Element Groups (EG) are:
	- I. Elements in support or through support on 2 bars.
	- II. Elements starting in upper arm position.
	- III. Long swings in hang on 1 or 2 bars and underswings.
	- IV. Dismounts.
2. Information on difficulty value:
	- For elements which include turns, the turns are not recognized as part of the element if the turn happens after the handstand position or after a hop to handstand. Examples: basket with inlocation and hop to handstand with turn or giant swing half turn with hop to handstand followed by turns.
	- Unless otherwise indicated, elements that deliberately regrasp in bent arm support are considered to have the same identification number and value as elements which regrasp in upper arm hang. However, elements that are initiated from bent arm support are considered to have the same identification number and value as elements from or through support.
	- Unless otherwise indicated in the difficulty tables, elements performed from or to unusual or rotated grip positions (supinated or pronated) have the same identification number and value as analogous elements performed from or to the usual grip position.
3. Additional information and regulations:
	- Many swinging elements lead, to or are defined to, a handstand on one or two rails. The handstands from swing need not be held, but the element must be performed in a manner that convincingly demonstrates that the handstand position could have been held if so desired.
	- Special rule: Elements to one bar in cross support have the same value as done to two bars, except they increase by one value more when connected to Healy type elements (each Healy element also increases by one value) hold is allowed in the one bar handstand.
	- Elements to one bar upgrade the value if is connected to healy type elements, but only if the Healy element is executed without large deduction.
	- No straddle element to one bar can receive an increase in difficulty value, i.e. Tippelt, Arican, etc.
	- All Healy must have 360° turns to be recognized as a Healy type element, beginning from two or one bar crossways. Note: A 3⁄4 Healy, from sideways position, is a B value and same box as Element I.50.
	- Performance expectation of Bhavsar. This element should be performed to regrasp with an open shoulder angle and straight body at horizontal. If the gymnast regrasps with a body position of more than 45° from horizontal and/or a 90° angle in the shoulder, no value will be given and a single large deduction will be taken.
	- Healy and Makuts type turns and salto forward to support type elements, with an extreme arm bend (greater than 90°) upon catching, will not be recognized for value.
	- A double salto forward with a 1⁄2 turn may be performed for value with either a late turn or an early turn on the 1⁄2 twist.
	- Tippelt performance expectations. The Tippelt is considered a swing element and as such must be performed with continuous movement. The legs must rise upon regrasp to the handstand position with no dropping of the legs or visible use of strength. Dropping of the legs, interruption in the upward movement or visible use of strength can result in execution deductions and possible non-recognition of the element.
	- Performance expectations of basket elements with turns. Basket with full turn, III.108, should be performed direct to handstand and without an additional hand placement. Basket with half turn, included in III.107 should be performed with max only one placement before arriving in completed handstand. If the basket is performed with two or more hand placements it will be valued as III.106 basket with quarter turn.
4. Special repetitions:
	- Elements with saltos: an exercise can not include more than one body/regrasp position variation of the same element (within the same EG). In this case the element with the highest difficulty value will be counted for difficulty. For clarification, the following elements collectively are included II.53, II.54, III.64, III.65, III.71 and III.77 in this rule. Some examples:
		- Morisue tuck or Morisue pike.
		- Belle tuck or Belle pike.
		- 5/4 Salto fwd straddled to up. arm hang or to bent arm support or directly to hang.
	- Maximum two Giant Swings through handstand (III.21, III.22, III.29, III.30, III.42, III.46, III.48).
	- Maximum two Basket Swings through handstand (III.106, III.107, III.108, III.114, III.119, III.120, III.130, III.131, III.137).
