**Exercise description**
A Floor Exercise is composed predominantly of acrobatic elements combined with other gymnastic elements such as strength and balance parts, elements of flexibility, handstands, and choreographic combinations all forming a harmonious rhythmic exercise which is performed utilizing the entire floor exercise area (12 m x 12 m).

**Table of Elements**
- [[EG I - Non-acrobatic elements]]
- [[EG II - Acrobatic elements forward]]
- [[EG III - Acrobatic elements backward]]

**Information about the "D Score"**
1. The Element Groups (EG) are:
	- I. Non-acrobatic elements.
	- II. Acrobatic elements forward.
	- III. Acrobatic elements backward.
2. The dismount cannot be from Element Group I.
3. A multiple salto element is required in the exercise and must be inside the 10 (8 for juniors) counting elements.
4. Information about Difficulty and elements group:
	- Acrobatic elements can be connected, but retain their independent values.
	- For floor exercise, one element can fulfill only one Element Group requirement. If one element is executed as dismount (Element Group II, or III), it can fulfill only the Dismount Group requirement, and the gymnast must include one more element from the same Element Group as the dismount inside the exercise in order to receive the respective Element Group value. The element used for the dismount is the first of five counted within a specific element group, except in the instance of basic repetition.
	- All Arabian elements are in the group of acrobatic elements backward, Example Arabian double front 1⁄2 = same as double back 1/1 (D value).
5. Information about connections (CV):
	- D or higher + B or C = +0.10.
	- D or higher + D or higher = +0.20.
	- Connections can be awarded on both sides of one element.  
	- For connection bonus, all elements must be inside the 10 counting elements (8 for junior).  
	- No connection for counter saltos (example Double salto bwd. 1/1 to salto fwd. 1/1).
	- No connection bonus will be given for directly connected single saltos with turns (example: salto bwd. with 5/2 turn to salto fwd. 1/1 turn).
	- If a gymnast completes two or more elements for connection bonus and receives a large deduction for any reason, then no connection bonus will be awarded for that particular connection.
6. Additional information and regulations:
	- One and a half salto elements with reception by and then spring from the hands are not permitted.
	- Salto rollouts and jumps to prone position are not permitted for value.
	- All permitted elements that finish with a rollout or finish in front support position are listed in the Difficulty Tables. For safety reasons, no new such elements are permitted.
	- Unless otherwise indicated in the Difficulty Tables, circle and flair elements have the same value and identification number. Wende swings with legs apart are not permitted.
	- Unlisted strength holds with straddled legs are not permitted.
	- Elements involving two strength parts for one Code value require a stop position in both strength parts to receive the listed value, a lower value will be awarded if a stop occurs for only one of the strength parts. Example: Manna (1 s.) and press handstand (no stop) = C value for the Manna.
	- All circles/flairs begin and end in front support.
	- No extra elements may be added before or after element I.82 for an increase in value. In principle only acrobatic elements can be awarded more than a D value.
	- All Japanese handstands require closing of the legs and requires the head to be within one hand thickness of the floor.
	- If a gymnast steps or lowers his legs and touches the floor while pressing to handstand, no value will be given for the press. However, they may still receive credit for the handstand if held.
	- Clarification concerning several acrobatic skills cannot be devalued if performed partly in a tuck position, for example salto forward straight with double turn, gymnasts can receive credit for the double turn if the bending occurs in the second turn but would be deducted for the Non-distinct positions (tuck, pike, straight).
7. Special repetitions:
	- A maximum of 2 strength elements (including strength handstands) may be performed in an exercise for content value. Elements I.1 to I.48 are considered to be strength elements, except:
		- Element I.19 - Handstand (2 sec).
		- Element I.31 - 1⁄2 or 1/1 turn in handstand or to handstand.
	- A maximum of 2 circle, flair or Russian elements may be performed in an exercise for difficulty value.
