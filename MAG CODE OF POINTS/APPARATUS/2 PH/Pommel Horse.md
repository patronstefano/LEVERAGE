**Exercise description**
A contemporary Pommel Horse exercise is characterized by a variety of support positions on all parts of the horse, permitting different types of circular swings with legs apart and together, single leg swings and/or scissors, and swings through the handstand position with or without turns. All elements must be executed with swing and without the slightest interruption of the exercise. Strength and hold elements are not permitted.

**Table of Elements**
- [[EG I -  Single leg swings and scissors]]
- [[EG II - Circle and flairs, with and-or without spindles and handstands, Kehrswings, Russian wendeswings, flops and combined elements]]
- [[EG III - Travel type elements, including Krolls, Tong Fei, Wu Guonian, Roth and Traveling Spindles]]
- [[2 PH/EG IV/EG IV - Dismounts|EG IV - Dismounts]]

**Information about the "D Score"**
1. The Element Groups (EG) are:
	- I. Single leg swings and scissors.
	- II. Circle and flairs, with and/or without spindles and handstands, Kehrswings, Russian wendeswings, flops and combined elements.
	- III. Travel type elements, including Krolls, Tong Fei, Wu Guonian, Roth and Traveling Spindles.
	- IV. Dismounts.
2. Additional information and regulations:
	- General:
		- Unless otherwise indicated, all circle elements (including travels, spindle and wenderswing), begin and end in front support.
		- Unless otherwise indicated all 1⁄2 turns (Czechkehres, Stöckli and reverse Stöckli), have the same value.
		- Unless otherwise indicated, each element is defined as occurring within one structure and ending when a new structure is initiated, as follows (Exception: the combined series provision):
			- A hop element ends at the completion of the hop or series of hops.
			- A circle or flair element ends when it changes to the other.
			- A spindle element ends when the spindle action stops.
			- A front support element (wendeswing) ends when the wende action stops.
			- Travel elements in cross support end when the travel action or the cross support position is either interrupted by a circle or some other element or is ended in some other way.
			- For difficulty recognition purposes, travelling elements can be considered finished as soon as the travel is completed.
			- Magyar and Sivado may share a common circle con- necting them and receive D+D difficulty. To receive credit for an A value circle between the two travels, the A value circle must be completed fully from front support to front support.
			- In the Code of Points Belenki, Urzica, and Moguilny (EG III) may begin from cross support (also facing out) minus 90° on first turn AND final turn, with travel from one end to the other.
		- For all travel in side support start position 1-2 and final position 4-5 considered as enough to fulfill requirements.
		- In order to further simplify the rules regarding falls, all listed elements in EGII and EGIII, require a listed CoP element afterwards for value. The only exception would be a swing forward with both legs (half circle) and finishing the circle with one leg, followed by simple leg swing or scissor. For example: On one pommel: L, L, S, S finishing the circle with one leg, followed by simple leg swing or scissor. D jury action: E value element and element without value If a fall occurs, no partial difficulty can be awarded. In the case of a fall after starting the subsequent element, the previous element will receive credit.
		- All Sohn and Bezugo type elements from a stand (and not from a circle element) will be valued two letters lower than the value from the listed element in the Code of Points. Sohn and Bezugo are defined from support on two pommels 360° turn to finish in front support on two pommels. If gymnast does not finish with hands on both pommels, there is no credit awarded for these specific elements.
		- A Russian Wendeswing to a dismount beginning in cross support facing out must complete Russian(s) as listed before the Wende to receive full dismount value.
		- A Wu Guonian requires a minimum 360° of body turn to be completed with one or two hands between the pommels. After Wu Guonian the gymnast might add any listed elements in the CoP (R180, R360, etc).
		- No additional elements may be added to increase the value of these elements:
			- Kehre fwd., rev. Stöckli, kehre fwd. (Element III.58, Moguilny).
			- Kehre bwd., kehre fwd., kehre bwd. (Element III.64, Belenki).
		- Clarification concerning the start position for travels backward; the gymnast is allowed to start these elements in rear support on the end of the horse facing out with both hands on the leather.
	- Circles:
		- All basic circles in cross and side support (also on one pommel) may end with a 1⁄4 turn without changing the structure or value of the element.
		- Step up to pommel, with or without 1⁄4 turn, is B value Circle with or without 1⁄4 turn on one pommel, and counts as start to flop sequence (Element II.14).
	- Handstand:
		- There is no upgrade in value for turning within a handstand from scissors.
		- There is no upgrade in value for the performance of turning within a handstand (from circles or flairs) solely on the pommels. Turning within a handstand requires a majority use of the leather.
		- When performing a 3/3 travel during a handstand (within an exercise or dismount), “support” with one hand must be shown on both ends of the horse to receive the 3/3 upgrade in value. There is no upgrade in value for additional turning, within a handstand from circles or flairs (indicated in the table below).
		- Swing with strength and/or lowering of the hips or legs in achieving handstands from a scissor or from circles or flairs (including dismounts) will receive the value for the element and element group (D jury) with E-jury deductions. However, if there is a large error, no recognition will be given for the handstand or dismount. In the case of a large deduction, the gymnast will receive a -0.5 deduction and only deductions for aesthetic errors (legs, feet, bent arms, touch horse, etc.). No deductions for strength or angle will be applied.
		- All scissors through handstand on one pommel require a change of arm or pommel to receive value.
	- Combined elements:
		- It is possible to combine certain elements on a single pommel. There are two types of such combined elements listed in the Element Group II:
			- Flop type elements may include combinations of any of the following on one pommel: circle in side support, circle in cross support (with or without 1⁄4 turn), Direct Stöckli B, and/or Direct Stöckli A, Bertoncelj and 3⁄4 Bezugo EG II.81:
				- The DSA may only appear at the end of the sequence.
				- Bertoncelj and 3⁄4 Bezugo EG II.81 may only appear at beginning of the sequence.
				- Such combined elements (flops) can only be of D, E or F value (i.e. 3 or 4 elements).
				- As an exception a D flop performed in flair = E, and an E flop performed in flair = F. Only one such flop sequence may be used in an exercise for value.
				- The following examples illustrate this rule:
					- DSB + DSB + DSA = D value flop.
					- Circle on one pommel + DSB + DSB + DSA = E value flop.
					- Bertoncelj + Circle on one pommel + DSB = E value flop.
			- Combined sequences on one pommel of circle and/ or Stöckli A or B, Bertoncelj and 3⁄4 Bezugo EG II.81 with Russian wendeswings. The circle and/or Stöckli B, (Bertoncelj and 3⁄4 Bezugo EG II.81 must precede) can either precede or follow the Russian wendeswings and must appear as 2 consecutive circle elements to be part of a two-flop Combined Sequence. The DSA may only appear at the end of the sequence. Only one of these combined sequences may be used during an exercise.
			- In any case when a combined element is involved, the gymnast will not have the right to make use of the same element three times in direct succession.
			- Flop and combined elements must be separated by minimum one circle with one hand off of the one pommel.
			- A DSB is considered finished in side support frontways on one pommel.
		- No other double elements will be credited for higher value. For example: 2 circles or 2 DSB’s in any position receive credit only for the first circle or DSB and no value or recognition for the second.
		- DSA requires 1⁄4 turn in and 1⁄4 out.
	- Spindles:
		- Spindles in EG II in cross or side support with legs together or flair must be performed within a maximum 2 circles (3 front support positions after the original start position) for D value.
		- There are two D value 1/1 Spindles (EG II) in the Code of Points:
			- Any side support pommel between hands 1/1 spindle w. legs straddle inside max. 2 circles. Element II.28.
			- Any cross or side support 1/1 spindle within max. 2 circles. Element II.34.
			- Both may be performed in the same exercise.
	- Dismounts:
		- Pommel Horse is the only apparatus where a dismount may be repeated (one time only) if the gymnast determines he may not have received credit because of a fall or a large deduction. This must be done within the allowable time. If the gymnasts steps off the podium (this includes the stairs), the exercise is terminated.
		- In the case of a repeated dismount, the gymnast has 30 seconds to remount the horse and perform any type of dismount of his choice for value and EG IV.
3. Special repetitions:
	- A maximum of two (3/3) cross support travels (forwards and/or backwards) are permitted during the exercise. This rule applies to the following eight travels ONLY:
		- III.39 Travel forward in cross support with support on leather, pommel, pommel, leather(3/3) (1-2-4-5).
		- III.40 Any other travel forward in cross support to other end (3/3).
		- III.41 Travel forward in cross support over both pommels.
		- III.42 3/3 cross support travel forward with hop.
		- III.45 From cross support on end, travel forward in 2 circles to 1st pommel, to 2nd pommel with 1⁄4 turn to side support on other end (3/3).
		- III.51 Travel backward in cross support with support on leather, pommel, pommel, leather(3/3) (5-4-2-1).
		- III.52 Any other travel backward in cross support to other end (3/3).
		- III. 53 Travel backward in cross support over both pommels.
	- A maximum of two Russian Wendeswings are permitted for value in an exercise, including the dismount. For Pommel Horse these special repetition rules are wider, any 2nd Russian Wenderswing element on the end including dismount or 2nd Russian Wenderswing element between pommels considered as repetition. The following examples illustrate this rule: Russian on the end 1080° + Russian 720° to wende = No value + C value. Russian between pommels 720° + Russian between pommels 1080° = No value + E value. Russian between pommels 360° + Russian on the end 1080° + Russian 360° to wende = C value + no value + B value (dismount is counted first). Excluded from the rule are flop/Russian combinations on one pommel.
	- A maximum of 2 handstand elements are permitted for value in an exercise from circles, flairs, or scissors (not including the dismount).
	- A maximum of two (3/3) Russian Wendeswings travel elements are permitted for value in an exercise. This rule applies to the following travels ONLY:
		- III.70 From support on end, Russian Wendeswings forward to other end without support on or between the pommels (side to side support, side to cross, cross to side, cross to cross).
		- III. 75 From support on 1 pommel, Russian Wendeswings forward to other end without support on or between the pommels (side to side support, side to cross support).
		- III.76 From support 1-2, 3/3 travel in Russian type Wendeswings with 630° or more turning.
		- III.77 Any 3/3 travel in Russian type Wendeswings with 720° or more turning.
		- III.81 From side support pommel between hand, Russian Wendeswings 360° with travel to the other end in side support.
		- III.82 Any Russian Wendeswings with 360° and 3/3 travel.
		- III.89 On the leather, from cross support, Russian Wendeswings with 360° or 540° over both pommels.
	- A maximum of two 3/3 travel with Spindle elements are permitted for value in an exercise. This rule applies to the following travels ONLY:
		- III.23 From an end side travel with 2 x 1⁄2 spindle to other end.
		- III.28 Cross travel forward 3/3 with 1⁄2 spindle from one pommel over the other pommel.
		- III.29 Travel 3/3 over both pommels with 1⁄2 spindle.
		- III.35 3/3 cross support travel in flair with 1/1 Spindle inside 2 circles.
	- A maximum of two full Spindle elements are permitted for value in an exercise. This rule applies to the following spindle ONLY:
		- II.28 Any side support 1/1 spindle with legs straddle inside maximum 2 circles.
		- II.29 Any side support 1/1 spindle with hand support to the other side and return (maximum 2 flairs or circles).
		- II.30 Side support, 1/1 spindle with both pommels between the hands (flair or circle).
		- II.34 Any 1/1 spindle within maximum 2 circles.
		- II.35 Cross support, 1/1 spindle with hands between the pommels maximum 2 circles.
		- II.41 1/1 spindle with legs straddle or together on the pommels inside maximum 2 circles.
	- A maximum of two Bezugo type elements, including combined and Handstands.
	- A maximum of two Sohn type elements, including combined and Handstands.
