**Description of a Vault**
The gymnast must perform one vault except in Qualification for Vault Finals and in Vault Finals, where he must show two vaults from different Vault Groups. Each vault begins with a run and a takeoff from both feet (with or without a round off) to the vault board with legs together and is executed with a brief support phase on the table with two hands. The vault may contain single or multiple turns around the two axes of the body. After the first vault, the gymnast returns without delay to the starting position and, at the signal of the D1 Judge, performs his second vault.

**Table of Elements**
- [[EG I - Single salto vaults with complex twists]]
- [[EG II -   Handspring vaults with or without simple twists,and all double salto fwd]]
- [[EG III - Handspring sideways and Tsukahara vaults with orwithout simple twists, and all double salto bwd]]
- [[EG IV - Round off entry vaults]]

**Information about the "D Score"**
1. The gymnast must show one vault in Qualification, Team Final and the All-Around Final. In the Qualification for Vault Final and in Vault Finals he must show two vaults, which must be from different Vault Groups:
	- I. Single salto vaults with complex twists.
	- II. Handspring vaults with or without simple twists, and all double salto fwd.
	- III. Handspring sideways and Tsukahara vaults with or without simple twists, and all double salto bwd.
	- IV. Round off entry vaults.
2. Each vault is listed, numbered, and given a value in the Difficulty Tables within its Group. The following general principles apply:
	- Cuervo vaults have the same value as equivalent Handspring Salto vaults with twists.
	- Kasamatsu vaults have the same value as the equivalent Tsukahara vaults.
	- Yurchenko vaults have the same value as the analogous Tsukahara or Kasamatsu vaults.
	- Unless otherwise indicated, round off entry vaults with 1⁄2 turn to the table have a value of 0.20 more than the analogous forward approach vaults.
	- Unless otherwise indicated, round off entry vaults with 3⁄4 or 1/1 turn to the table have a value of 0.60 more than the analogous Tsukahara vaults.
3. Each vault is given a unique Difficulty Value based on its complexity.
4. Prior to the execution of each vault, the appropriate vault number, as assigned in the Code of Points must be displayed for the D-jury. This function is performed by the gymnast, or an assistant, with the aid of a flashboard and is not penalized in the case of error. Example: #319 - The #3 designates the vault group; the #19 designates the vault number within that vault group.
5. The gymnast must show the intended body position (tucked, piked, or straight) in a distinct and unmistakable manner. Non-distinct body positions may result in non-recognition by the D-Jury or recognition as a vault with a lower Difficulty Value. The gymnast must display the vault number for the vault that he can do, not the one he hopes to do. This warning applies especially for the recognition of straight and piked positions.
6. The placement mat may be used for round off entry vaults only, and is optional.
7. The vault is invalid (0.00 point from the D-Jury and the E-Jury) when:
	- The vault is executed without a support phase, i.e., neither hand or only one hand touches the table.
	- Failure to use the safety collar for round off entry vaults.
	- The vault is so poorly executed that the intended vault cannot be recognized, or the gymnast pushes from the table with his/her feet.
	- Spotting assistance during the vault.
	- The gymnast does not land with his feet first. This means that at least one foot must contact the landing mat before any other part of the body.
	- The gymnast lands intentionally in a side stand.
	- The gymnast performs a prohibited vault (straddled legs in the second flight phase, salto in the first flight phase, prohibited pre-element before the vaulting board, etc.).
	- The first vault is repeated for the second vault in Qualification for Vault Final or in Vault Final.
	- A video review by D-panel and Apparatus supervisor will automatically occur for every vault receiving an Invalid “0“ Score. All E-Jury judges enter their deductions after every vault performed. The D jury will notify them in the case of a “0” vault and advise them of the method to present a “0” E-score.
8. For Vaults performed with a Round off 1/2 turn in the first flight, it is possible to be deducted for insufficient turn. Normal deductions will be taken as per the table of errors for incomplete twist. In extreme cases if the lack of turn is greater than 90° from the correct position, the Vault will be recognized as a Yurchenko style Vault.
9. During the 30 second warm up, each gymnast is permitted 2 Vaults (maximum). This applies during any phase of the competition where the warm up is occurring on the podium. The gymnast is entitled to their 2 warm up Vaults even if the 30 second warm up time has expired. The Line Judge will be responsible for ensuring that the 2 Vault maximum is respected. Failure to respect the 2 Vault maximum rule will result in a neutral deduction of 0.3 taken from the first Vault.
10. In Qualification, Team Final, and All-Around Final:
	- One vault must be performed.
	- In Qualification, the 1st vault score counts toward the Team and/or All-Around Total.
	- For Qualification and in the Apparatus Final, each gymnast must perform two different vaults which must be from different Vault Groups. In Qualification and in the Apparatus Final, the average score of the 2 vaults will determine the final score for the gymnast.
11. Additional run approaches are permitted as follows, with deduction of 1.00 for empty run (if gymnasts has not touched the springboard or apparatus):
	- When 1 vault is required, a second run approach is permitted with deduction. Third approach not permitted.
	- When 2 vaults are required, a third run approach is permitted with deduction. Fourth approach not permitted.
