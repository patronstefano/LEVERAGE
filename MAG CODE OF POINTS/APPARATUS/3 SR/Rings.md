**Exercise description**
An exercise on the Rings is composed of swing, strength and hold parts in approximately equal portions. These parts and combinations are executed in a hang, to or through a support, and to or through the handstand position. Contemporary Rings exercises are characterized by transitions between elements of swing and strength or the reverse where execution with straight arms should predominate.

**Table of Elements**
- [[EG I - Kip and swing elements & swings through or to handstand (2 sec.)]]
- [[EG II - Strength elements and hold elements (2 sec.)]]
- [[EG III - Swing to Strength hold elements (2 sec.)]]
- [[3 SR/EG IV/EG IV - Dismounts|EG IV - Dismounts]]

**Information about the "D Score"**
1. The Element Groups (EG) are:
	- I. Kip and swing elements & swings through or to handstand (2 sec.).
	- II. Strength elements and hold elements (2 sec.).
	- III. Swing to Strength hold elements (2 sec.).
	- IV. Dismounts.
2. One Swing to handstand element (2 s. hold) is required in the exercise and must be inside 10 counting elements and inside the 8 counting elements for Juniors.
3. Repeated elements (same Code Identification Number):
	- Repeated elements cannot contribute to the “D” score. On Rings, this rule is extended so that not more than 3 elements from groups II and/or III can be presented in direct succession. The 4th and subsequent Elements from Group II and/or III of the same sequence will be considered as repetition, and not recognized by the D jury.
	- If the gymnast decides to execute more elements from Element Groups II and/or III, in order to be recognized by the “D” Jury, he must perform at least a B value swing element from elements Group I (except any kind of kip/back kip, or element in the same Code box) between the first sequence of maximum 3, and another element or sequence from Element Groups II and/or III. This swing element of at least a B value must be recognised and among the 10 best (8 for Juniors) counting elements.
	- All elements performed from EGII or EGIII contribute to this rule whether they are inside the counting ten elements or not, even if the element is not recognised due to poor technical execution.
4. Special repetitions:
	- Repeated elements (same Code Identification Number) cannot contribute to the “D” score. On Rings, this rule is extended so that a maximum of 1 final strength position in each EG may be recognized for difficulty. Thus, for example only two cross type elements (regular, L cross, or V cross) or support scale type elements (regular or straddled) are permitted in an exercise for difficulty value (one in Group II and one in Group III).
	- A maximum of 2 Guczoghy type elements can be present in the exercise.
	- Basic support positions, i.e. L sit and V sit are not included in the special repetition rule as they are deemed to be different strength elements. It is possible to perform uprise to forward to L sit and uprise forward to V sit. However, it would not be possible to perform more than one final strength position in each element group, i.e. Kip to L sit and uprise to L sit.
5. Additional information and regulations:
	- Strength holds positions that deviate from the correct body, arm or leg position by greater than 45° will not be recognised. Examples: Cross with shoulder angle >45°, support scale with hip bend of >45°.
	- Strength presses and lifts which follow a previous hold element and end in a 2 second hold position are recognized only if the preceding hold part has been recognized and if a stop position is shown.
	- Swing elements that lead to strength hold elements which must reverse direction (i.e. front uprise to Swallow; front uprise to inverted cross and so on ...) will be counted as two elements.
	- All V hold positions (2 sec.) must be performed with legs vertical.
	- Elements with crossing of the cables or to “Li Ning” hanging position are not permitted, being deducted as composition errors.
	- For juniors, elements which include saltos backward in hang are not permitted.
	- A dorsal hang to Cross or V Cross is not an acceptable entry position to elevate the value for either cross (or any other strength element). If either cross is performed directly from a dorsal hang, each will retain its independent Code of Points value (B or C respectively).
