**Exercise description**
A contemporary Horizontal Bar Exercise must be a dynamic presentation that consists entirely of the fluid connection of swinging, turning, and flight elements alternating between elements performed near to and far from the bar in a variety of hand grips so as to demonstrate the full potential of the apparatus.

**Table of Elements**
- [[EG I - Long hang swings with and without turns]]
- [[EG II - Flight elements]]
- [[EG III - In bar and Adler elements]]
- [[6 HB/EG IV/EG IV - Dismounts|EG IV - Dismounts]]

**Information about the "D Score"**
1. The Element Groups are (EG):
	- I. Long hang swings with and without turns.
	- II. Flight elements.
	- III. In bar and Adler elements.
	- IV. Dismounts.
2. Additional information and regulations:
	- Unless otherwise indicated, the value and identification numbers of elements listed in the Difficulty Tables are the same if performed from handstand, from a back swing, or from some other position.
	- Unless otherwise indicated, elements have the same difficulty value and identification number when performed with the “wrong grip” or atypical grip positions.
	- Elements that end in a double elgrip have one letter superior value than the same elements ending in one arm elgrip.
	- Starting flight elements with any grip variation has the same value and identification number as starting or regrasping with two hands.
	- Unless otherwise indicated regrasping with any grip variation has the same value and identification number as regrasping with two hands.
	- All Endo, Stalder, Weiler and Kip Elements with turn are divided up in two Elements except Stalder Rybalko. Example:
		- Endo + 1/1 turn to El-Grip = B + C.
		- Stalder + 1⁄2 turn to El-Grip = B + B.
	- Elements with hops to handstand, which include turns, must initiate the turn during the hop and must regrasp with the second hand only after the turn has been completed. A regrasp may occur initially with one hand and then the second hand as the turn is completed. A hop element is considered finished at the moment that both hands regrasp the bar.
	- Clarifications for Quast:
		- Visible hop and fluid turn, not turning on the supporting arm.
	- Clarifications for Giant swing bwd. with hop 3/2 turn (into el-grip = Rybalko):
		- Prerequisite condition is both hands in mixed el-grip or el-grip in end position.
		- Visible hop and fluid turn, not turning on the supporting arm.
		- Giant swing bwd. with hop 3/2 t. to one arm giant swing (Rybalko to one arm giant swing) is the same value and box as Rybalko to undergrip or mixed el-grip (Element I.51).
		- A giant bwd. swing with hop and more than 3/2 turn is prohibited (2/1 and more turn).
		- This rule also applies to all Stalder with hop 3/2 turn (into el-grip = Rybalko ) type elements.
	- Rybalko or Piatti from Stalder with legs together are not permitted.
	- Turning elements in one hand support position must be considered as finished at the moment the gymnast re-grasps the bar with the second hand. Piatti style elements from the stoop circle (feet on bar) are not permitted.
3. Flight elements from el-grip and dismounts from el-grip or dorsal hang have the same value as elements performed in regular grip.
4. Special repetitions:
	- A maximum of two Stoop Circle Rearward forward through handstand elements (Adler type) are permitted. In this case the elements with the highest difficulty value will be counted.
	- Elements with turns: an exercise cannot include more than one grip variation of the same element. In this case the elements with the highest difficulty value will be counted as consistent with the Special Repetition rules of the other apparatus. Some examples:
		- Rybalko in double el grip or Rybalko in mixed grip or Rybalko one hand grip.
	- Only two Tkatchev or Piatti style flight elements are permitted. Only two Kovacs style flight elements are permitted. Three of the same style flight elements are only permitted if one is directly connected (to any style release). Example:
		- Kolman and after Kovacs + Gaylord II.
		- Kolman + Kovacs and after Cassina.
		- Tkatchev straight + Tkatchev and after Liukin.
		- Tkatchev + Gienger and after Tkatchev Straight and after Piatti.
5. Regrasping Tkatchev 1⁄2 or Yamawaki 1⁄2 elements without sufficient turning and continuing to handstand (or directly connecting to a release element) will receive no value.
6. For an el-grip or Russian giant to be recognized directly after an Adler or turn to el-grip, the el-grip or Russian giant requires a swing over the bar in el-grip in order to receive a value.
7. A Zou Li Min executed with insufficient turning (greater than 90° deviation on first full twist) will not be recognized by the D-jury and receive a -0.5 deduction by the E-jury. This element may not be devalued to a Giant Swing Fwd. with one arm in undergrip (B value). One arm giant swing fwd. with 1/1 t. to el-grip and 1/1 t. to undergrip (Zou Li Min, Element I.27) cannot be combined with any other element for an increase in value.
8. The Yamawaki element must be straight when passing through a vertical body position over the bar for no deductions. An excessive pike or a poor vertical position over the bar will be deducted and could also lead to recognition of a B value flight element.
9. Flight elements always receive value if a distinct hang phase is shown before the gymnast falls.
10. Endo in el-grip through handstand (Element III.93). For the recognition of this element the gymnast must start the element in el-grip handstand and must go over the top of the bar in el-grip at the end of the element.
11. An El-grip giant swing (Element I.68) and Giant swing rearways fwd. (Russian giant, Element I.69) only require going over the top of the bar in el-grip to receive their listed value. No specific amount of a giant swing in el-grip is required in order for the element to be recognized. Sequence examples:
	- Adler to 65° from handstand, swing in-elgrip through the bottom and over the top, swing in elgrip through the bottom and hop out to undergrip = value for Adler (and -0.5 angle deduction) and B value el-grip giant.
	- Adler to handstand, swing in el-grip through the bottom and over the top into el-grip Endo, swing through the bottom in el-grip Endo, swing in el-grip through the bottom and hop out to under- grip = C value Adler, B value el-grip giant, C value el-grip Endo.
12. Flights elements with 1⁄2 turns to mixed el-grip must have more than 50% of the turn completed upon catching the bar in order to receive no deduction while continuing to back uprise to handstand. E-jury deductions of small, medium, large should be applied for any insufficient turning upon catching the bar.
13. Stoop circle fwd. to straddle cut to hang or sup (Element III.103). Gymnast may enter at any angle from a giant swing or swing forward.
14. Regarding the performance expectations for the exit from the Czech giant. A simple stoop exit from dorsal hang is permitted without an angular deviation deduction, but also does not receive any value.
15. Endo, Stalder, Weiler and Adler Elements. For recognition these elements must continue over the bar in the intended direction.
16. Regarding the Tkatchev straight: the element must be performed with a straight body throughout the element until regrasping the bar. If the gymnast bends his body greater than 45° before passing over the bar, it will be recognized as a Tkatchev pike = C value. If the gymnast bends his body after passing over the bar he will receive the D value, but would receive appropriate execution deductions.
17. Information about Connections (CV):
