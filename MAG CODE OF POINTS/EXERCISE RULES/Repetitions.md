1. An exercise may not be repeated unless the gymnast has to interrupt his exercise for reasons outside of his control.
2. If the gymnast falls on or from the apparatus, he may choose to continue with his exercise from the fall or to repeat the missed element for credit and continue from there.
3. No element (same Code Identification Number) may be repeated for difficulty credit or for Connection Points. This applies also to elements repeated in connections (exceptions: certain Pommel Horse elements and circles that increase in value if performed twice in special combinations, and Rings).
4. If the difficulty of an element is not recognized for any reason, then that element can also not meet an Element Group Requirement.
