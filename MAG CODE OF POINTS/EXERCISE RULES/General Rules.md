Two separates scores, “D” and “E”, will be calculated on all apparatus:
1. The D-jury determine the “D” score, the content of an exercise, and the E-jury the “E” score, i.e. the exercise presentation related to compositional requirements, technique and body position.
2. “D” score content will include by addition:
	- The additional difficulty value of 10 elements (8 for juniors), the best 9 (7 for juniors), but maximum 5 elements for the same Element Group, inside the best counting plus the value of the dismount. If the judge needs to choose the counting 9 (7 for juniors) elements from elements which have the same value but belong to different Element Groups, he must determine them to the benefit of the gymnast. Once the 9 (7 for juniors) best counting elements plus the dismount of the exercise are determined, the judge must count among them not more than 5 elements from the same element group (for FX, the Element Group of the dismount will count first).
	- The connections value, based on special rules on different apparatus.
	- Element Group Requirements Value, performed among the 10 counting elements (8 for juniors).
3. “E” score, will start from 10 points and will evaluate by deductions applied in tenths of a point:
	- The total deductions for aesthetic and execution errors.
	- The total deductions for technical and compositional errors.
4. The highest and the lowest sums of total deductions applied in tenths of a point for execution, aesthetic, technical and compositional errors are eliminated. The average remaining sums is subtracted from the 10 points in order to determine the Final “E” Score.
