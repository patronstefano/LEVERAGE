# LEVERAGE 1.0.0 - November 2023

LEVERAGE is a custom add-in for Obsidian developed to support the management of complexity in Artistic Gymnastics and released freely by Patron Stefano - Uninettuno International Telematic University, Faculty of Engineering, Rome, Italy.

LEVERAGE mainly relies on the 2022-2024 Code of Points of Men’s Artistic Gymnastics, approved by the International Gymnastics Federation.

---

This software rises from the need to organize and manage the complex rules and dynamics existing in Artistic Gymnastics in a simple and effective way, in order to offer coaches a support tool to improve the technical preparation of athletes developing the potentiality of sports analytics.

The implementation of the project in Obsidian allows to create connections and assign specific properties to data, simultaneously developing a mathematical graph structure, in order to reduce the complexity of information for a more efficient management.

From a conceptual point of view, the usage of related database query results in a DBMS directed to the information system of Gymnastics, able to examinate several athletes belonging to different teams and categories at the same time, evaluating their technical characteristics and results achieved during competitions. The user can also interactively consult the Code of Points to create gymnastics exercises, whose correct composition and difficulty is automatically checked through a special plugin directly implemented in the software.

**Note: "Gymnastics Plugin" of Stefano Patron is directly included in this software.**
